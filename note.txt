Here's the feature I want to build: An app that is like a todo list app. It's for kids. When open the app, list out all the kids name and a plus button to add new kid. Once a name is chosen, show today's todo task list for the selected kid. Also, a plus button to add new task. On each task, have a checkbox next to it so that kid can check it when it's done. When all tasks are done on that date, show an excellant badge for the kid. Clicking the task will allow to edit it. At the top, show today's date, and a button to open a calendar to jump to other date of that kid. Also show a button to go back to the select kids page. The design of the app should be user friendly for tablet mainly use in portrait view. Write the app in React, NextJS, tailwind css, firebase
